# Clinical Cases: Chronic Urticaria Management
## Based on AAAAI/ACAAI JTFPP Systematic Reviews (2024-2025)

---

## TIER 1: FOUNDATIONAL CASES

### Case 1.1: The LTRA Decision
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 34-year-old woman with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) presents for follow-up. She has been taking cetirizine 10mg daily with partial improvement. Her UAS7 is 24 (moderate severity). She asks if she should add montelukast before increasing her antihistamine dose.

**Key Learning Points:**
- LTRAs provide "small, potentially patient-unimportant" benefit (MD -5.04, BELOW MID of 10)
- No RCT compares LTRA + standard-dose AH vs. 4× updosed AH
- Guidelines recommend updosing antihistamines BEFORE adding LTRA

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is the minimally important difference (MID) for UAS7?
2. How does the LTRA effect size compare to the MID?
3. What counseling is required before prescribing montelukast?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Rayner 2024 systematic review, LTRAs improve urticaria activity by MD -5.04 on UAS7, which is BELOW the MID threshold of 10 points. This represents a "small, potentially patient-unimportant" benefit. Additionally, the FDA boxed warning requires counseling about neuropsychiatric events (NNH 161). The more evidence-based approach is to updose cetirizine to 4× standard dose (40mg daily) before considering add-on therapies.

### Case 1.2: The Steroid Flare
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 28-year-old man with CSU presents to urgent care with a severe flare. His UAS7 is 38 (severe). He takes fexofenadine 180mg twice daily (4× dose) with good baseline control but developed widespread hives after a viral illness. He asks for prednisone.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Systemic corticosteroid NNT varies by antihistamine responsiveness
- In antihistamine-refractory patients: NNT = 7
- In antihistamine-responsive patients: NNT = 45
- Short course (<1 week) may be appropriate for acute flares

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Is this patient's baseline urticaria antihistamine-responsive or refractory?
2. What is the NNT for systemic corticosteroids in his current state?
3. What is the NNH for adverse events?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Chu X 2024 systematic review, this patient is currently antihistamine-REFRACTORY (severe flare despite 4× antihistamine). The NNT is 7, meaning meaningful benefit is expected. However, the NNH is 9 (~15% increased AE risk). A short course (<1 week) of prednisone (e.g., 40mg daily × 5 days) is reasonable for acute flare management, with clear counseling that steroids are NOT disease-modifying.

---

### Case 1.3: Topical Therapy Question
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 45-year-old woman with symptomatic dermographism (chronic inducible urticaria) develops wheals along her bra line and waistband daily. Standard antihistamines provide 50% improvement. She asks if she can apply topical steroids to prevent wheals in these areas.

**Key Learning Points:**
- TCS may reduce wheal size by ~50% (LOW certainty)
- Very uncertain effect on itch
- HIGH certainty for safety (no increased AEs)
- Practical for localized urticaria; impractical for widespread disease

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is the evidence for topical corticosteroids in chronic urticaria?
2. Why might TCS reduce wheal size but not itch?
3. Is this an appropriate clinical scenario for TCS?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Chu AWL 2024 systematic review, TCS may reduce wheal size by approximately 50% (RoM 0.47) with LOW certainty, but the effect on itch is very uncertain. TCS poorly inhibit acute mast cell degranulation (histamine release), which explains the dissociation between wheal and itch effects. For this patient with highly localized, predictable dermographism, prophylactic TCS application to high-friction areas is a reasonable option given HIGH-certainty safety data. This is "absence of evidence, not evidence of absence."

## TIER 2: INTERMEDIATE CASES

### Case 2.1: The Biologic Selection
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 52-year-old woman with CSU and intermittent angioedema has failed 4× antihistamines and a trial of montelukast. Her UAS7 is 32, CU-Q2oL is 55, and she has angioedema episodes 2-3× per month. She has no significant comorbidities. You are discussing biologic options.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Omalizumab and remibrutinib: HIGH certainty for urticaria activity, angioedema, AND QoL
- Dupilumab: Moderate certainty for urticaria activity but NO angioedema data
- Patient has prominent angioedema — this should influence selection

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which biologics have HIGH-certainty evidence for angioedema improvement?
2. Why is dupilumab less ideal for this patient?
3. What are the differences between omalizumab and remibrutinib?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Chu AWL 2025 NMA, both omalizumab 300mg Q4W (+8.75% more angioedema-free weeks, HIGH certainty) and remibrutinib (+15.00% more, HIGH certainty) have robust evidence for angioedema improvement. Dupilumab improved urticaria activity but the CUPID trials did NOT report angioedema outcomes — this is a critical evidence gap. For a patient with prominent angioedema, omalizumab or remibrutinib are preferred. Omalizumab has more long-term safety data; remibrutinib offers oral administration.

### Case 2.2: The Comorbidity Consideration
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 38-year-old man with CSU also has moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis requiring systemic therapy. His UAS7 is 28 and his EASI score is 22. He asks if one medication can treat both conditions.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Dupilumab is FDA-approved for both CSU and atopic dermatitis
- Consider comorbidities when selecting biologics
- Dupilumab lacks angioedema data for urticaria

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which biologics are approved for multiple atopic conditions?
2. What are the advantages of using dupilumab for this patient?
3. What outcome data is missing for dupilumab in CSU?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Dupilumab (anti-IL-4Rα) is FDA-approved for both CSU (2024) and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. For this patient with both conditions, dupilumab offers "one drug, two diseases" — simplifying therapy and potentially reducing costs. Per the Chu AWL 2025 NMA, dupilumab improves urticaria activity (MD -6.01, moderate certainty). However, counsel that NO trials reported angioedema outcomes — if he develops angioedema, this would be a reason to consider switching to omalizumab.

---

### Case 2.3: The Cyclosporine Dilemma
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 48-year-old woman with severe, refractory CSU has failed omalizumab 300mg Q4W × 6 months (partial response, UAS7 decreased from 38 to 22). She cannot afford to continue omalizumab and asks about cyclosporine.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Cyclosporine may be MOST effective for urticaria activity (MD -10.18)
- Cyclosporine may be MOST harmful (+21% more AEs)
- Requires careful monitoring
- Consider omalizumab updosing as alternative

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is the evidence for cyclosporine efficacy?
2. What is the evidence for cyclosporine harm?
3. What monitoring is required?
4. Is omalizumab updosing an option?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Chu AWL 2025 NMA, cyclosporine may be among the most effective treatments (MD -10.18 on UAS7) but may also be among the most harmful (+21% more adverse events). Both are LOW certainty. Before switching, consider omalizumab updosing — case series suggest 69% of standard-dose non-responders may respond to 300mg Q2W or 450-600mg Q4W. If proceeding with cyclosporine, require monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and lipids every 4-8 weeks. Plan for short-term use (3-6 months) rather than indefinite therapy.

## TIER 3: ADVANCED CASES

### Case 3.1: The NNT/NNH Counseling
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 42-year-old physician with CSU wants to understand the numbers behind treatment decisions. She asks you to explain the evidence for adding montelukast versus short-course prednisone for her current flare.

**Key Learning Points:**
- LTRAs: NNT 8 for urticaria activity, effect below MID, NNH 161 for neuropsychiatric AEs
- Systemic CS (refractory): NNT 7, NNH 9
- Understanding NNT/NNH helps shared decision-making

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How do you explain NNT and NNH to patients?
2. What is the net benefit of each option?
3. How does evidence certainty affect interpretation?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
For LTRAs (Rayner 2024): NNT 8 means treating 8 patients for 1 additional responder, but the improvement (MD -5.04) is below the MID of 10 — so even "responders" may not notice meaningful benefit. The NNH 161 for neuropsychiatric events means 1 in 161 patients may experience mood changes, sleep disturbances, or worse.

For systemic corticosteroids in antihistamine-refractory flares (Chu X 2024): NNT 7 means meaningful benefit (1 in 7 respond), but NNH 9 means 1 in 9 experience adverse events — a less favorable ratio than LTRAs but for a more meaningful effect.

The physician-patient can use this to decide: LTRAs have lower risk but also lower reward; short-course steroids have higher risk but higher reward. For an acute flare, steroids may be reasonable; for maintenance, neither is ideal — escalate to biologics.

### Case 3.2: The Failed Biologics Discussion
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 55-year-old man with severe CSU asks why his insurance denied ligelizumab after reading that it was "more effective than omalizumab" in early trials. He also asks about benralizumab since it helped his asthma.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Ligelizumab development discontinued (PEARL trials: no superiority)
- Benralizumab (anti-IL-5) failed for CSU (ARROYO trial)
- Anti-TSLP (tezepelumab) also failed for CSU
- Understanding mechanistic reasons for failure

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why did ligelizumab fail despite promising early results?
2. Why don't anti-IL-5 antibodies work for urticaria?
3. What does this teach us about urticaria pathophysiology?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Chu AWL 2025 NMA:
- **Ligelizumab** showed no superiority over omalizumab in PEARL-1 and PEARL-2 trials, leading to discontinuation of development. Early Phase 2 results were promising but didn't replicate in Phase 3.
- **Benralizumab** (anti-IL-5) failed in the ARROYO trial (MD -2.84, not different from placebo). This makes pathophysiologic sense: eosinophils are not central drivers of urticaria, unlike in eosinophilic asthma.
- **Tezepelumab** (anti-TSLP) also failed in INCEPTION (MD -2.00). Type 2 skin inflammation appears to be TSLP-independent, unlike airway inflammation where TSLP is a key initiator.

This teaches us that urticaria is driven by the IgE-mast cell axis (hence omalizumab, remibrutinib success) and IL-4/IL-13 signaling (hence dupilumab success), NOT by eosinophils or TSLP.

### Case 3.3: The Pipeline Preview
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 35-year-old woman with severe, refractory CSU has failed omalizumab (including updosing) and cannot tolerate cyclosporine. She asks about "new drugs in clinical trials."

**Key Learning Points:**
- Remibrutinib: Phase 3 positive (REMIX-1, REMIX-2), likely approval soon
- Barzolvolimab: Anti-KIT showing disease-modifying potential (41% complete remission sustained)
- BTK inhibitors (fenebrutinib, rilzabrutinib) in development
- Understanding drug pipeline helps set expectations

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is the mechanism of remibrutinib?
2. What makes barzolvolimab potentially disease-modifying?
3. What options exist for truly refractory patients today?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
**Remibrutinib** is an oral BTK inhibitor that blocks FcεRI signaling downstream of IgE binding. The REMIX-1 and REMIX-2 Phase 3 trials showed HIGH-certainty efficacy comparable to omalizumab. FDA approval is anticipated.

**Barzolvolimab** (anti-KIT) targets the receptor tyrosine kinase on mast cells. Phase 2 data showed 41% complete remission maintained 7 months after discontinuation — suggesting potential disease modification rather than just symptom suppression. Phase 3 trials are ongoing.

For truly refractory patients today, options include:
1. Clinical trial enrollment (search ClinicalTrials.gov for "chronic spontaneous urticaria")
2. Combination immunomodulators (very uncertain evidence)
3. Mycophenolate or sulfasalazine (very low certainty, non-RCT data only)
4. Shared decision-making about cyclosporine (high efficacy, high harm)

### Case 3.4: The Ethical Dilemma — LTRAs and Informed Consent
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 29-year-old woman with mild CSU (UAS7 14) controlled on cetirizine 20mg BID asks for montelukast because she "read online it helps hives." She has a history of depression, well-controlled on sertraline.

**Key Learning Points:**
- LTRAs have FDA boxed warning for neuropsychiatric events
- Effect is below MID — modest benefit at best
- History of depression may increase risk
- Shared decision-making is essential

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How do you counsel about the FDA boxed warning?
2. Should her psychiatric history change your recommendation?
3. What are alternatives?

**Evidence-Based Response:**
Per the Rayner 2024 systematic review, LTRAs provide only MD -5.04 improvement on UAS7, below the MID of 10. For a patient with already mild disease (UAS7 14), the expected benefit is marginal.

The FDA boxed warning requires counseling about neuropsychiatric events (agitation, sleep disturbances, depression, suicidal ideation). Her history of depression is a relative concern — while the NNH is 161 overall, patients with psychiatric history may be at higher risk.

Shared decision-making approach:
- Explain that benefit is modest and may not be noticeable
- Review the FDA boxed warning in detail
- Discuss alternatives: optimize antihistamine dosing, lifestyle modifications
- If proceeding, document informed consent and plan for close monitoring
- Consider psychiatry consultation if any new mood symptoms develop

## INTEGRATED ALGORITHM CASE

### Case 4.1: The Complete Workup
**Clinical Vignette:**
A 40-year-old woman presents with 3-month history of daily hives and intermittent facial swelling. No identifiable triggers. She has tried loratadine 10mg daily without improvement. Walk through her complete evidence-based management.

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

**Step 1: Diagnosis**
- CSU diagnosis (>6 weeks, no trigger)
- Associated angioedema present
- Rule out differential diagnoses (urticarial vasculitis, autoinflammatory syndromes)

**Step 2: First-Line — Antihistamine Optimization**
- Current: Loratadine 10mg daily (standard dose) ❌ Inadequate
- Next: Updose to 4× (loratadine 10mg QID or switch to cetirizine 10mg QID)
- Assess response at 2-4 weeks

**Step 3: If Still Inadequate — Consider Add-On (Limited Evidence)**
- LTRAs: MD -5.04 (below MID), NNH 161 for neuropsychiatric AEs
- Per evidence: Modest benefit, requires FDA warning counseling
- Decision: May add if patient accepts limited benefit/risk profile

**Step 4: If Still Inadequate — Biologic Therapy**
- First choice: **Omalizumab 300mg Q4W**
  - HIGH certainty for efficacy (urticaria, angioedema, QoL)
  - HIGH certainty for safety
  - Angioedema present → omalizumab preferred over dupilumab (no data)
- Alternative: **Remibrutinib** (if available)
  - HIGH certainty for efficacy
  - Oral administration
  - Less long-term safety data
- Alternative: **Dupilumab** (if type 2 comorbidities)
  - Moderate certainty for urticaria activity
  - NO angioedema data — less ideal for this patient

**Step 5: If Biologic Inadequate (After 4-6 Months)**
- Omalizumab updosing: 300mg Q2W or 450-600mg Q4W
- ~69% may respond (case series data)
- If still inadequate: Consider cyclosporine (efficacy vs. harm tradeoff)

**Step 6: For Acute Flares**
- Short-course systemic corticosteroids (<1 week)
- Only if antihistamine-refractory at that moment
- NNT 7, NNH 9

**Step 7: For Localized Symptoms**
- Topical corticosteroids may be considered
- Limited role for widespread disease
- ~50% wheal reduction (low certainty), uncertain itch effect
