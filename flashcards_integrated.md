**Q:** What is the recommended duration for systemic corticosteroids in urticaria flares?
**A:** <1 week (short course)

---

### Card 21
**Q:** Are systemic corticosteroids disease-modifying in urticaria?
**A:** No — they suppress symptoms but don't alter natural history

---

## TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS

### Card 22
**Q:** What is the effect of TCS on wheal size?
**A:** ~50% reduction (RoM 0.47, LOW certainty)

---

### Card 23
**Q:** What is the effect of TCS on itch?
**A:** Very uncertain (MD -1.30, VERY LOW certainty)

---

### Card 24
**Q:** Why do TCS reduce wheals but have uncertain effect on itch?
**A:** TCS poorly inhibit rapid mast cell degranulation (histamine release)

---

### Card 25
**Q:** Evidence certainty for TCS short-term safety?
**A:** HIGH certainty — no difference in adverse events

---

### Card 26
**Q:** What percentage of dermatology visits for urticaria include TCS prescriptions?
**A:** 28%

---

### Card 27
**Q:** What type of urticaria is TCS most appropriate for?
**A:** Highly localized urticaria or chronic inducible urticaria (dermographism, pressure urticaria)

---

## TREATMENT RANKINGS

### Card 28
**Q:** Rank by evidence CERTAINTY for urticaria activity: omalizumab, cyclosporine, LTRAs, topical CS
**A:** Omalizumab (HIGH) > LTRAs (moderate) > Cyclosporine (low) = TCS (low)

---

### Card 29
**Q:** Which treatment categories showed NO differential effect between CSU and CIndU?
**A:** All treatments — subgroup analyses found no differential effects by urticaria subtype

---

### Card 30
**Q:** What is the effect size for mycophenolate on UAS7?
**A:** MD -15.01 (VERY LOW certainty, non-RCT data only)

---

## EMERGING THERAPIES

### Card 31
**Q:** What is the mechanism of remibrutinib?
**A:** BTK inhibitor — blocks FcεRI signaling downstream of IgE binding

---

### Card 32
**Q:** What makes barzolvolimab potentially disease-modifying?
**A:** Anti-KIT antibody; 41% complete remission sustained 7 months after stopping treatment

---

### Card 33
**Q:** Which BTK inhibitor has positive Phase 3 results (REMIX-1, REMIX-2)?
**A:** Remibrutinib

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

### Card 34
**Q:** Why does anti-TSLP (tezepelumab) work for asthma but not urticaria?
**A:** Type 2 skin inflammation is TSLP-independent; airway inflammation requires TSLP

---

### Card 35
**Q:** Why does dupilumab work for urticaria?
**A:** IL-4 and IL-13 are critical for IgE production and may directly promote mast cell activation

---

### Card 36

**A:** IL-4 and IL-13

---

## CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING

### Card 37
**Q:** Patient has CSU with prominent angioedema. What should you NOT choose?

---

### Card 38
**Q:** Patient wants an oral biologic. What is the option?
**A:** Remibrutinib (BTK inhibitor, oral administration)

---

### Card 39
**Q:** When should you use cyclosporine for CSU?
**A:** Truly refractory cases where biologics have failed or are unavailable; short-term use preferred

---

### Card 40
**Q:** What monitoring is required for cyclosporine?
**A:** Blood pressure, renal function, lipids (every 4-8 weeks)

---

## SAFETY

### Card 41
**Q:** Evidence certainty that omalizumab doesn't increase serious AEs?
**A:** HIGH certainty

---

### Card 42

**A:** HIGH certainty

---

### Card 44
**Q:** What is the risk difference for any AE with cyclosporine vs. placebo?
**A:** +21% more (LOW certainty)

---

## EVIDENCE GAPS

### Card 45

**A:** 1) No dupilumab angioedema data, 2) No LTRA vs. 4× AH comparison, 3) No high-dose omalizumab comparative trials

---

### Card 46
**Q:** Why is there no RCT data for mycophenolate in CSU?
**A:** The only identified RCT had concerns about data integrity and was excluded

**A:** Very limited — only 1 trial included participants under 12 years old

---

## QUICK NUMBERS

### Card 48
**Q:** UAS7 range and meaning of higher scores
**A:** 0-42; higher scores = greater severity

---

### Card 49
**Q:** CU-Q2oL range and meaning of higher scores
