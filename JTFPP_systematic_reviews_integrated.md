**Total Evidence Base:** 158 studies, approximately 16,000 participants

## 1. SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS (Chu X et al. 2024)

### Key Findings
- **Urticaria Activity:** Improved with **moderate certainty**
- **NNT varies by antihistamine responsiveness:**
  - Antihistamine-REFRACTORY: NNT = 7 (more benefit)
  - Antihistamine-RESPONSIVE: NNT = 45 (minimal additional benefit)
- **Adverse Events:** NNH = 9 (~15% increased risk)

### Clinical Implications
| Scenario | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Acute flare, antihistamine-refractory | Consider short course (<1 week) | NNT 7, meaningful benefit |
| Antihistamine-responsive urticaria | Avoid systemic steroids | NNT 45, risk outweighs benefit |
| Long-term management | Not recommended | AE risk, rebound, no disease modification |

### Evidence Gaps
- Optimal dose and duration undefined
- No trials comparing different corticosteroid regimens
- Limited safety data beyond short-term use

## 2. LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS (Rayner DG et al. 2024)

### Key Findings
| Outcome | Effect (MD/RR) | NNT/NNH | Certainty | Clinical Meaning |
|---------|----------------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Urticaria Activity (UAS7) | -5.04 | 8 | Moderate | **BELOW MID** (MID=10) |
| Itch Severity | -0.25 | 11 | Moderate | Modest |
| Wheal Severity | -0.25 | 13 | Moderate | Modest |
| Sleep Disturbance | 0.00 | — | Low | No effect |
| Quality of Life | -3.51 | 8 | Low | May help |
| Neuropsychiatric AEs | RR 1.08 | 161 | Low | Small uncertain risk |

### Bottom Line
**LTRAs provide "small, potentially patient-unimportant" benefits** — effects fall BELOW minimally important difference thresholds.

### Critical Evidence Gap
**No RCT compared LTRA + standard-dose antihistamine vs. 4× updosed antihistamine** — this is the clinically relevant comparison per guidelines.

### FDA Boxed Warning Context
- Neuropsychiatric events (sleep disturbances, depression, suicidal ideation)
- Risk appears small in urticaria population (NNH 161)
- Requires shared decision-making and patient counseling

## 3. TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS (Chu AWL et al. 2024)

### Key Findings
| Outcome | Effect | Certainty | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Wheal Size | RoM 0.47 (~50% reduction) | **Low** | Surrogate outcome |
| Itch Severity | MD -1.30 (NRS 0-10) | **Very Low** | Very uncertain |
| Adverse Events | OR 0.61 (no difference) | **High** | Safe short-term |

### Mechanistic Insights
- TCS cause localized vasoconstriction and reduce vascular permeability
- **Poor rapid inhibition of mast cell degranulation** explains limited itch effect
- May deplete mast cell granules and numbers over time (as in cutaneous mastocytosis)

### Practical Limitations
- Evanescent, migratory nature of hives makes topical application challenging
- Concerns about skin thinning with prolonged/diffuse use
- Systemic antihistamines more practical for widespread urticaria

### Clinical Role
| Scenario | Appropriateness |
|----------|-----------------|
| Highly localized urticaria | May consider |
| Chronic inducible (dermographism, delayed pressure) | May consider |
| Widespread/migratory urticaria | Impractical — favor systemic therapy |
| Long-term treatment | Avoid (atrophy risk) |

### Guideline Inconsistency
- Some guidelines recommend TCS for physical urticarias
- Others state TCS should never be used
- **This review suggests "absence of evidence" rather than "evidence of absence"**

### KEY CLINICAL MESSAGES

#### Top-Tier Treatments (HIGH Certainty for Multiple Outcomes)
1. **Standard-dose Omalizumab (300mg Q4W)** — Proven efficacy across urticaria activity, angioedema, QoL; favorable safety; longest track record
2. **Remibrutinib** — Similar efficacy to omalizumab; oral administration; less long-term safety data

#### Second-Tier Treatments
3. **Dupilumab** — Improves urticaria activity; **NO angioedema data**; consider for type 2 comorbidities (atopic dermatitis, CRSwNP)
4. **Low-dose Omalizumab** — Intermediate efficacy; cost consideration; may step up if partial response

#### Use with Caution
5. **Cyclosporine** — May be most effective but **may be most harmful** for adverse events; reserve for refractory cases; requires monitoring

#### Failed or Discontinued Drugs
- **Ligelizumab** — Development discontinued (no superiority over omalizumab in PEARL trials)
- **Benralizumab** — ARROYO trial negative
- **Tezepelumab** — INCEPTION trial showed limited efficacy
- **Quilizumab** — QUAIL trial negative

#### Very Uncertain Evidence
- Mycophenolate, sulfasalazine (no RCTs)
- Azathioprine, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine (low-certainty evidence)
- Methotrexate (MUCIS trial disappointing)

### Subgroup Findings
**No differential treatment effects by:**
- Age (pediatric vs adult)
- Risk of bias (low vs high)
- Antihistamine-refractory status
- Chronic urticaria subtype (CSU vs CIndU)
- Baseline disease severity

## INTEGRATED TREATMENT ALGORITHM (Based on All 4 Reviews)

### Step 1: First-Line
**Second-generation H1-antihistamine** (standard dose)
- If inadequate → updose to 4× (guideline recommendation)

### Step 2: Add-On Options (Limited Evidence)
**LTRAs (e.g., montelukast)**
- Small, potentially patient-unimportant benefit (below MID)
- Requires counseling re: FDA boxed warning
- **Critical gap:** No trials vs. 4× antihistamine alone

### Step 3: Biologics/Immunomodulators
**First choice: Omalizumab 300mg Q4W**
- HIGH certainty for efficacy across multiple outcomes
- HIGH certainty for safety (serious AEs not different from placebo)
- Consider if inadequate response at 4-6 months: increase frequency or dose

**Alternative: Remibrutinib** (where available)
- Similar efficacy (HIGH certainty)
- Oral administration
- Less long-term safety data

**Alternative: Dupilumab** (where available)
- Improves urticaria activity
- Consider if type 2 comorbidities
- **Caution:** No angioedema efficacy data

### Step 4: Refractory Disease
**Cyclosporine**
- May be most effective
- **May be most harmful** — requires monitoring
- Short-term use preferred

**Other immunomodulators** (very uncertain evidence)
- Mycophenolate, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine
- Consider in resource-limited settings or when biologics unavailable

### Acute Flares
**Short-course systemic corticosteroids** (<1 week)
- Only in antihistamine-REFRACTORY acute flares (NNT 7)
- Avoid in antihistamine-responsive patients (NNT 45)

### Localized Urticaria
**Topical corticosteroids** (limited role)
- May reduce wheal size ~50% (low certainty)
- Very uncertain effect on itch
- Consider for highly localized or chronic inducible urticaria
