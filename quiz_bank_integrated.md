# Quiz Bank: Chronic Urticaria Treatment Evidence
## Based on AAAAI/ACAAI JTFPP Systematic Reviews (2024-2025)

---

## SECTION 1: BIOLOGICS & IMMUNOMODULATORS (Chu AWL 2025 NMA)

### Question 1.1
Which of the following treatment combinations have HIGH-certainty evidence for efficacy across urticaria activity, angioedema, AND quality of life?

A) Omalizumab and dupilumab
B) Omalizumab and remibrutinib
C) Dupilumab and cyclosporine
D) Remibrutinib and cyclosporine

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Per the Chu AWL 2025 NMA, only omalizumab 300mg Q4W and remibrutinib have HIGH-certainty evidence for ALL THREE outcomes (urticaria activity, angioedema, quality of life). Dupilumab has moderate-certainty evidence for urticaria activity but NO published data on angioedema outcomes. Cyclosporine has only LOW-certainty evidence.

---

### Question 1.2
A 45-year-old woman with CSU and prominent angioedema (3-4 episodes/month) is starting biologic therapy. Which evidence gap is most relevant to her treatment selection?

A) No RCTs have compared omalizumab doses
B) No dupilumab trials reported angioedema outcomes
C) Remibrutinib lacks long-term safety data beyond 52 weeks
D) Cyclosporine has not been compared to placebo

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The most clinically relevant evidence gap for this patient is that NO dupilumab trials reported angioedema outcomes. Since she has prominent angioedema, this makes dupilumab a less ideal choice compared to omalizumab or remibrutinib (both have HIGH-certainty angioedema data). While C is also true, the angioedema data gap directly impacts her treatment decision.

---

### Question 1.3
Which biologic was discontinued from development after Phase 3 trials showed no superiority over omalizumab?

A) Benralizumab
B) Tezepelumab
C) Ligelizumab
D) Quilizumab

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** Ligelizumab development was discontinued after the PEARL-1 and PEARL-2 trials showed no superiority over omalizumab. Benralizumab failed in the ARROYO trial (not comparative to omalizumab). Tezepelumab showed limited efficacy in INCEPTION. Quilizumab failed in the QUAIL trial.

---

### Question 1.4
A patient asks why benralizumab didn't work for her CSU despite helping her asthma. Which pathophysiologic explanation is most accurate?

A) Type 2 skin inflammation is TSLP-independent
B) Eosinophils are not central drivers of urticaria
C) CSU is driven by IgG autoantibodies, not IgE
D) Benralizumab doesn't penetrate skin tissue

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Benralizumab (anti-IL-5) targets eosinophils, which are central to eosinophilic asthma but NOT central drivers of urticaria. Urticaria is driven by mast cell degranulation via the IgE-FcεRI axis. This is why anti-IgE (omalizumab) and BTK inhibitors (remibrutinib) work, but anti-IL-5 does not. Option A describes why tezepelumab failed, not benralizumab.

---

### Question 1.5
According to the NMA, which treatment may be MOST effective for urticaria activity but may also be MOST harmful for adverse events?

A) Azathioprine
B) Cyclosporine
C) Methotrexate
D) Dapsone

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Cyclosporine may be among the most effective treatments (MD -10.18 on UAS7, LOW certainty) but may also be among the most harmful (+21% more adverse events, LOW certainty). This creates the "cyclosporine paradox" — efficacy comes with significant safety concerns. It should be reserved for truly refractory cases.

---

### Question 1.6
The NMA found no differential treatment effects by which of the following factors?

A) Drug dose and administration frequency
B) Age, risk of bias, antihistamine-refractory status, and urticaria subtype
C) Study sponsor and geographic location
D) Baseline IgE levels and ASST positivity

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Subgroup analyses in the NMA showed NO differential treatment effects by age (pediatric vs. adult), risk of bias (low vs. high), antihistamine-refractory status, CSU vs. CIndU subtype, or baseline severity. This means the same treatment rankings apply regardless of patient characteristics.

---

## SECTION 2: LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS (Rayner 2024)

### Question 2.1
What is the mean difference in UAS7 for LTRAs compared to antihistamines alone?

A) -2.04 (very small effect)
B) -5.04 (small, below MID)
C) -10.04 (at MID threshold)
D) -15.04 (large, clinically meaningful)

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Per the Rayner 2024 systematic review, LTRAs improve urticaria activity by MD -5.04 on UAS7, which falls BELOW the minimally important difference (MID) threshold of 10 points. This represents a "small, potentially patient-unimportant" benefit.

---

### Question 2.2
Which critical comparison has NOT been studied in RCTs for LTRAs?

A) LTRA + standard-dose AH vs. standard-dose AH alone
B) LTRA + standard-dose AH vs. 4× updosed AH alone
C) LTRA monotherapy vs. AH monotherapy
D) Different LTRAs vs. each other

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** No RCT has compared LTRA + standard-dose antihistamine vs. 4× updosed antihistamine alone — this is the clinically relevant comparison per guidelines that recommend updosing before adding LTRA. All existing trials compared LTRA + AH vs. AH alone.

---

### Question 2.3
What is the number needed to harm (NNH) for neuropsychiatric adverse events with LTRAs in urticaria patients?

A) 9
B) 45
C) 77
D) 161

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** The NNH for neuropsychiatric adverse events with LTRAs is 161 (LOW certainty), meaning approximately 1 in 161 patients may experience mood changes, sleep disturbances, depression, or suicidal ideation. This risk must be communicated per the FDA boxed warning.

---

### Question 2.4
What effect do LTRAs have on sleep disturbance in chronic urticaria?

A) Significant improvement (MD -2.50)
B) Modest improvement (MD -1.00)
C) No effect (MD 0.00)
D) Worsening (MD +1.50)

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** Per the Rayner 2024 review, LTRAs have NO effect on sleep disturbance (MD 0.00, LOW certainty). This contradicts claims that LTRAs improve nocturnal symptoms.

---

## SECTION 3: SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS (Chu X 2024)

### Question 3.1
What is the NNT for systemic corticosteroids in antihistamine-REFRACTORY acute urticaria?

A) 3
B) 7
C) 15
D) 45

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The NNT for systemic corticosteroids in antihistamine-REFRACTORY patients is 7, meaning treating 7 patients results in 1 additional responder. This is meaningful benefit. In contrast, the NNT in antihistamine-RESPONSIVE patients is 45.

---

### Question 3.2
What is the NNT for systemic corticosteroids in antihistamine-RESPONSIVE urticaria?

A) 7
B) 15
C) 30
D) 45

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** The NNT for systemic corticosteroids in antihistamine-RESPONSIVE patients is 45, meaning minimal additional benefit. This is why systemic steroids should be avoided in patients whose urticaria responds to antihistamines.

---

### Question 3.3
What is the NNH for adverse events with short-course systemic corticosteroids?

A) 3
B) 9
C) 45
D) 161

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The NNH for adverse events with systemic corticosteroids is 9, representing approximately 15% increased risk. This must be weighed against the NNT (7 for refractory, 45 for responsive) when deciding on therapy.

---

### Question 3.4
A patient with CSU controlled on 4× antihistamines develops a severe flare after a viral illness (UAS7 increased from 8 to 36). What is the most appropriate short-term intervention?

A) Add montelukast (NNT 8)
B) Start omalizumab (HIGH certainty)
C) Short-course prednisone (NNT 7)
D) Start cyclosporine (MD -10.18)

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** This patient was antihistamine-RESPONSIVE at baseline but is currently antihistamine-REFRACTORY (severe flare despite 4× AH). For acute flares in refractory patients, short-course systemic corticosteroids (<1 week) have NNT 7 with moderate certainty. LTRAs have modest benefit below MID. Biologics take weeks to work and are not for acute flares. Cyclosporine has significant safety concerns.

---

## SECTION 4: TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS (Chu AWL 2024)

### Question 4.1
What is the effect of topical corticosteroids on wheal size in urticaria?

A) No effect (RoM 1.00)
B) ~25% reduction (RoM 0.75)
C) ~50% reduction (RoM 0.47)
D) ~75% reduction (RoM 0.25)

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** Per the Chu AWL 2024 review, topical corticosteroids may reduce wheal size by approximately 50% (RoM 0.47, 95% CI 0.38-0.59) with LOW certainty.

---

### Question 4.2
Why do topical corticosteroids reduce wheal size but have very uncertain effects on itch?

A) TCS poorly penetrate the dermis where mast cells reside
B) TCS poorly inhibit rapid mast cell degranulation (histamine release)
C) TCS only affect vascular permeability, not nerve fibers
D) TCS are metabolized too quickly to affect itch mediators

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** TCS cause vasoconstriction and reduce vascular permeability (→ smaller wheals) but have poor ability to rapidly inhibit mast cell degranulation and histamine release. This explains the dissociation between wheal reduction and uncertain itch effects. Over time, TCS may deplete mast cell numbers (as in cutaneous mastocytosis), but acute effects on itch are limited.

---

### Question 4.3
What is the evidence certainty for topical corticosteroid safety in short-term use?

A) Very low certainty
B) Low certainty
C) Moderate certainty
D) High certainty

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** There is HIGH certainty that short-term TCS use results in little to no difference in adverse events (OR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.35-1.06). This was derived using Bayesian analysis incorporating data from atopic dermatitis trials.

---

### Question 4.4
Which statement best reflects the guideline inconsistency regarding topical corticosteroids for urticaria?

A) All guidelines recommend TCS as first-line therapy
B) Some guidelines recommend TCS for physical urticarias while others state TCS should never be used
C) Guidelines universally recommend against TCS due to proven inefficacy
D) TCS are only recommended for pediatric urticaria

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Per the Chu AWL 2024 review, there is guideline inconsistency — some guidelines recommend TCS for physical urticarias (chronic inducible urticaria) while others state TCS should never be used. The review suggests this represents "absence of evidence rather than evidence of absent efficacy."

---

## SECTION 5: INTEGRATED EVIDENCE QUESTIONS

### Question 5.1
Rank these treatments from HIGHEST to LOWEST evidence certainty for urticaria activity improvement:

A) Omalizumab > Cyclosporine > LTRAs > Topical CS
B) Omalizumab > LTRAs > Topical CS > Cyclosporine
C) Cyclosporine > Omalizumab > LTRAs > Topical CS
D) LTRAs > Omalizumab > Topical CS > Cyclosporine

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:** Ranking by evidence certainty:
1. Omalizumab: HIGH certainty
2. Cyclosporine: LOW certainty (but effect estimate present)
3. LTRAs: MODERATE certainty
4. Topical CS: LOW certainty (and limited to surrogate outcome)

Note: LTRAs have moderate certainty but the effect is below MID. Cyclosporine has low certainty but potentially larger effect. The key is understanding certainty vs. effect magnitude.

---

### Question 5.2
A patient asks: "What's the best add-on to antihistamines before starting a biologic?" Based on the JTFPP systematic reviews, which answer is most evidence-based?

A) "Montelukast definitely helps — it's the standard step 2."
B) "Short-course steroids work great for maintenance."
C) "The evidence for add-ons before biologics is limited — LTRAs have modest benefit below clinically meaningful thresholds."
D) "Topical steroids are the bridge between antihistamines and biologics."

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The evidence-based answer acknowledges the limitations: LTRAs provide MD -5.04 (below MID of 10), systemic steroids are not for maintenance (only acute flares), and topical CS have limited role for widespread urticaria. The honest answer is that add-on therapies before biologics have LIMITED evidence, which is why guidelines now recommend earlier biologic initiation for refractory cases.

---

### Question 5.3
Which factor does NOT influence treatment selection between omalizumab and dupilumab for CSU?

A) Presence of comorbid atopic dermatitis
B) Presence of prominent angioedema
C) Whether the urticaria is spontaneous vs. inducible
D) Presence of comorbid food allergy

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The NMA found NO differential treatment effects between CSU and CIndU subtypes. Treatment selection should be based on:
- Angioedema (favors omalizumab — dupilumab lacks data)
- Atopic dermatitis (favors dupilumab)
- Food allergy (favors omalizumab — FDA approved)

NOT by urticaria subtype, which doesn't affect treatment response.

### Question 5.4
Match each treatment to its most concerning evidence gap:

| Treatment | Evidence Gap |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Dupilumab | A. No RCTs exist |
| 2. LTRAs | B. No angioedema outcomes reported |
| 3. Mycophenolate | C. No comparison to 4× AH |
| 4. High-dose omalizumab | D. No comparative trials in naive patients |

A) 1-B, 2-C, 3-A, 4-D
B) 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, 4-D
C) 1-B, 2-A, 3-D, 4-C
D) 1-C, 2-B, 3-D, 4-A

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
1. Dupilumab — No angioedema outcomes reported (B)
2. LTRAs — No comparison to 4× updosed AH (C)
3. Mycophenolate — No RCTs exist (A)
4. High-dose omalizumab — No comparative trials in omalizumab-naive patients (D)

---

### Question 5.5
A patient with CSU is completely controlled on omalizumab 300mg Q4W. She asks about switching to remibrutinib because "it's newer." What counseling is most appropriate?

A) "Switch immediately — remibrutinib is superior to omalizumab."
B) "Remibrutinib has similar efficacy but less long-term safety data. Since omalizumab is working, there's no clear benefit to switching."
C) "Remibrutinib only works for CIndU, not CSU."
D) "You can't switch biologics — you must fail cyclosporine first."

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Per the NMA, omalizumab and remibrutinib have similar HIGH-certainty efficacy across multiple outcomes. The key difference is that omalizumab has extensive long-term safety data while remibrutinib has limited data (LOW certainty for safety). Since she's well-controlled on omalizumab, there's no evidence-based reason to switch. "Newer" doesn't mean "better."
